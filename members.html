									<b>Dr. Sungchul Jung</b><br>
									<b>Assistant Professor, Lab Supervisor</b><br><br>
									I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Game Design and Development at Kennesaw State University. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida in 2018. I was a postdoctoral fellow researcher at the Human Interface Technology Lab (HIT Lab) in New Zealand, from 2018 to 2021. My research interests lie in the field of eXtended Reality (VR/MR/AR)  and data-driven Empathic Computing based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective. Based on the findings from my research, I am leveraging the fully personalized virtual reality experience for social relationships, education, learning and collaboration, entertainment, simulation, game design, and healthcare. I am actively working on academic service as a reviewer, program committee, and editor at prestigious venues such as IEEE VR, ACM VRST, IEEE ISMAR, ACM CHI, and Frontiers.</p>

									<b>Nicholas Wile</b><br>
									<b>M.S. Student, Graduate Research Assistant</b><br><br>
									I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Software Engineering and Game Development. I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, and I graduated summa cum laude from Kennesaw State University in 2022 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Game Design and Development. My research interests are broad and vary with each project I work on, with a current focus in game design and development, computer graphics and multimedia, and machine learning. I am currently designing and developing virtual reality and machine learning applications for the Immersive Empathic Interface Lab for use in human behavioral research. My most recent project, a VR Classroom System, won first place in the Spring 2023 KSU Computing Showcase!</p>
