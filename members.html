									<b>Dr. Sungchul Jung</b><br>
									<b>Assistant Professor, Lab Supervisor</b><br><br>
									I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Game Design and Development at Kennesaw State University. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida in 2018. I was a postdoctoral fellow researcher at the Human Interface Technology Lab (HIT Lab) in New Zealand, from 2018 to 2021. My research interests lie in the field of eXtended Reality (VR/MR/AR)  and data-driven Empathic Computing based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective. Based on the findings from my research, I am leveraging the fully personalized virtual reality experience for social relationships, education, learning and collaboration, entertainment, simulation, game design, and healthcare. I am actively working on academic service as a reviewer, program committee, and editor at prestigious venues such as IEEE VR, ACM VRST, IEEE ISMAR, ACM CHI, and Frontiers.

									<b>Nicholas Wile</b><br>
									<b>Graduate Research Assistant, M.S. Computer Science Student</b><br><br>
									I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Kennesaw State University (KSU) Department of Software Engineering and Game Development, and I have been working in the Immersive Empathic Interface Lab since January 2023. I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at KSU, and I graduated summa cum laude from KSU in 2022 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Computer Game Design and Development. In the lab I have been designing and developing virtual reality software from the ground-up, maintaining existing VR applications, and optimizing and integrating machine learning models into VR apps, for use in research. Most recently I created an eye-tracking VR classroom system, utilized by 24 students at KSU, to study changes in user experience and perception in virtual reality, and my project was awarded 1st place in the 2023 KSU Computing Showcase. I also help the other lab members solve any technical issues they have, and I made the lab website that you’re reading right now. (Hello!) My expertise lies in game design and development, game engines, and computer graphics. I have additional interest and experience in virtual reality, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
